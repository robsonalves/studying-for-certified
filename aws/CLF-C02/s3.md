Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a highly scalable object storage service that provides secure, durable, and highly available data storage infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **Object Storage**: Provides object storage through a web interface.
- **Anytime Access**: Allows users to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web.
- **High Durability and Availability**: Data is stored redundantly across multiple facilities and devices.
- **Security Options**: Includes encryption and access control mechanisms.
- **Advanced Features**: Supports versioning, lifecycle policies, and cross-region replication.
- **Globally Unique Bucket Names**: Bucket names must be globally unique.
- **Object Size**: Each object can range from 0 KB to 5 TB.
- **Region-Based Buckets**: Buckets are defined per region; S3 is a global service, but buckets are tied to regions.
- **Not a Filesystem**: S3 is not a traditional filesystem; objects are accessed via unique keys.
- **Keys and Prefixes**: Object keys may contain prefixes that simulate folder structures.

## Use Cases

- Storing images, audio, video, big data, archives.
- Hosting static websites.
- Backup and restore solutions.
- Log storage and analytics.

## Notable Customers

S3 is used by companies such as Netflix, Pinterest, NASA, Coca-Cola, and more.


## S3 Encryption

There are two main types of encryption used in Amazon S3:

### 1. Server-Side Encryption (SSE) - *Default*
- Objects are encrypted **by the server** after they are uploaded.
- This is the **default** encryption method in S3.
- Several types of SSE exist (e.g., SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, SSE-C), though detailed distinctions may not be required for foundational exams.

### 2. Client-Side Encryption (CSE)
- Objects are encrypted **by the client** before they are uploaded to S3.
- AWS **does not have access** to the unencrypted data and cannot see what is behind the encryption.

This separation is important to understand when dealing with data security and compliance in cloud architectures.


## Object Versioning

Object Versioning in Amazon S3 allows you to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in a bucket. Once enabled, versioning cannot be disabled—only suspended.

### Key Concepts

- **Versioning cannot be disabled**, only suspended.
- Older versions of objects are stored "under" newer versions.
- **By default**, when retrieving an object, **S3 returns the most recent version**.
- Deleted objects are not removed but **hidden under delete markers**.
- You can **undelete** objects by removing the delete marker.
- You can **permanently delete** specific versions via the “Show Versions” UI.
- **Version ID** can be used when programmatically accessing object versions.
- **Storage costs apply for all versions** of an object retained in the bucket.

This is an essential feature for data protection, auditing, and disaster recovery in S3-based systems.
